Rails Events project
====================
Deployed at http://clancyhwang.herokuapp.com

It's a web application to create/modify/delete/update events,
and even register for events.
Try it out, 
notice:
Only create events that are at least two days or more in the future
(old events is automatically set to not-shown and there is a time zone issue)
